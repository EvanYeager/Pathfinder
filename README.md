# Pathfinder
This is an A* pathfinder I created for Unreal Engine 4.

This algorithm works on a square grid-based system. Given an array of tiles and their information, it will find the optimal path from the starting location to the target location, taking into account unpassable tiles and the "movement cost" of each tile in the path.
